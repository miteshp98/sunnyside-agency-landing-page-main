## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively implement a mobile-first approach and create a fluid layout that adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes. Here are the key areas I focused on:

Mobile-First Approach:

Designed the layout with mobile users as the primary audience, ensuring a solid foundation for smaller screens.
Gradually enhanced the design for larger screens using media queries.
Fluid Layout:

Utilized flexible units like percentages and viewport-based dimensions to ensure elements resize gracefully.
Applied responsive typography and images to maintain aesthetics and readability across devices.
Navbar Toggle:

Implemented a toggle button for the navigation bar to enhance usability on mobile devices.

```js
const navToggleButton = document.querySelector(".nav__toggle_button");
const navMenu = document.querySelector(".nav__toggle");

navToggleButton.addEventListener("click", function () {
  navMenu.classList.toggle("collapse");
});
```
